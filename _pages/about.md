I am currently working as an early-stage researcher in the PERSEO project at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. My research is on <span class="bolded"> combining vision and language for the application of robotic navigation </span>. Previously, I have worked on emotion expressions in Human-Robot Interaction (TU Darmstadt), human activity recognition and prediction (Inria, Nancy), comparison of deontology and utilitarianism in Pac-Man game setting using knowledge representation (Rovira i Virgili University / Open University of Catalonia) as well as on the underlying mechanism to explain the development of visual attention to faces during infancy (Osaka University).
